# Feature Engineering & Variable Transformation Summary

In this section, we focus on preparing data for machine learning through **Feature Engineering** and **Variable Transformation**.

## Key Topics Covered

1. **Variable Transformation**
   - Used to adjust data distribution and handle outliers.
   - Example: **Log Transformation** for skewed data.

2. **Feature Encoding**
   - Categorical data needs to be converted to numerical format for model compatibility.
   - Techniques include:
     - **One-Hot Encoding**
     - **Label Encoding**

3. **Feature Scaling**
   - Ensures that features have similar scales, crucial for algorithms sensitive to feature magnitude.
   - Common methods:
     - **Standardization** (Z-score scaling)
     - **Normalization** (Min-Max scaling)

4. **Model Assumptions**
   - Many machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression) assume specific relationships between data.
   - Example: Linear models assume **linear relationships** between predictors and the target.

### Linear Regression Example
   - Formula: \( y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot x1 + \beta_2 \cdot x2 \)
   - `β1` and `β2` are coefficients for predictor variables (e.g., cast and marketing budgets) impacting the target (e.g., revenue).

### Transforming for Better Fit
   - Variables like `x1` and `x2` can be transformed (e.g., log or polynomial transformations) to achieve a **linear relationship** and improve model fit.
